<h1>Important</h1>

I write somewhere in one of the posts in the series about the useful tool install all the prerequisites. This can be found in the *lib\NServiceBus.2.1.0.1305\tools\MsmqUtils* but I recommend running *lib\NServiceBus.2.1.0.1305\RunMeFirst.bat* instead. Since this installs services and modifies registry you need to run this as administrator.

If you do not create the queues manually you would also need to run Visual Studio as an administrator.
